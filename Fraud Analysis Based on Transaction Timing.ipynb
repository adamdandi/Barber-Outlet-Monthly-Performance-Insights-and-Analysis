This document is created to analyze potential anomalies in transaction times within Barberking's operational services. These anomalies could indicate fraud or process discrepancies that require further investigation.\n\nThis analysis focuses on the transaction times performed by each barber, aiming to identify suspicious patterns through the calculation of the average transaction time delay. This effort aligns with the organization's goal to improve operational efficiency, fairness in commission distribution, and early detection of potential deviations.\n\n## **Objectives**\n\n1. **Detect Anomalies**: Identify barbers with the highest average transaction time delays to detect possible fraud or non-compliant practices.\n2. **Determine Transaction Patterns**: Analyze normal transaction patterns compared to outliers to provide insights into potential operational issues.\n3. **Provide Recommendations**: Generate data-driven recommendations to enhance trust in the payment system and improve operational efficiency.\n\n## **Scope**\n\nThis analysis includes:\n- Transaction data from all Barberking outlets within the specified period.\n- Key variables: **OrderNo**, **OrderDate**, **OrderTime**, and **ServeBy**.\n- Focus on transaction time patterns, including average and distribution of time delays between transactions.\n- Assumptions that each order number (**OrderNo**) represents a unique transaction.\n\nLimitations:\n- Excludes transactions outside the given period.\n- Potential data errors, such as inconsistent time recordings, cannot be fully eliminated.\n\n## **Methodology/Approach**\n\n1. **Data Processing**: Grouping data by barber (**ServeBy**) and order number (**OrderNo**) to calculate the time delay between transactions.\n2. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculating daily average transaction delays and using statistical methods to identify outliers.\n3. **Comparison**: Comparing barbers to detect individuals with suspicious transaction patterns.\n4. **Reporting Results**: Presenting findings through visualizations and summaries that aid in decision-making.\n\n## **Expected Outcomes**\n\n1. A list of barbers with the highest average transaction time delays.\n2. Identification of specific days or periods with suspicious transaction patterns.\n3. Actionable recommendations for further investigation and fraud prevention policies.\n4. Contribution to improving system efficiency and transparency in operations.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nfrom pandasql import sqldf\n\n#load dataset\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/salesbk/SALESBK.csv\")\n#define lambda to run sql query\nsql = lambda q: sqldf(q, globals())","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-20T08:59:07.272477Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-20T08:59:07.272903Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-20T08:59:07.309704Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-20T08:59:07.272866Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-20T08:59:07.308559Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#query 1 grouping data by barberman, date, and time of transaction\nquery1= \"\"\"\nSELECT \n    ServeBy, \n    OrderNo, \n    MIN(OrderDate || ' ' || OrderTime) AS TransactionTime,\n    OrderDate\nFROM data\nGROUP BY ServeBy, OrderNo, OrderDate\nORDER BY ServeBy, OrderDate, TransactionTime;\n\"\"\"\n#run query1\ndata_group=sql(query1)\n#show result\nprint('grouping data by barberman, date, and time of transaction')\nprint(data_group)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-20T08:59:07.311939Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-20T08:59:07.312329Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-20T08:59:07.490289Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-20T08:59:07.312288Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-20T08:59:07.489138Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#query2 Using LAG to calculate the time lag between transactions\nquery2=\"\"\"\nSELECT \n    ServeBy, \n    OrderDate,\n    TransactionTime,\n    LAG(TransactionTime) OVER (PARTITION BY ServeBy, OrderDate ORDER BY TransactionTime) AS PreviousTransaction,\n    (strftime('%s', TransactionTime) -

Barbers with the highest average time gaps, such as Ahmad Arif Setiono (108.59 minutes) and Barberman David (108.54 minutes), may:\n   - Provide more detailed or premium services, requiring additional time per client.\n   - Face delays due to inefficiencies or other external factors.\n\n2. **Moderate Performers:**\n   - Barbers with average time gaps around the mean (e.g., Barberman Abdul at 96.75 minutes) represent a balance between quality and efficiency.\n\n3. **Efficient Performers:**\n   - Barbers like Muhammad Aliev Mustanir (88.70 minutes) and Dimas Ari Susanto (88.42 minutes) demonstrate quicker service, which could result from:\n   - Streamlined processes.\n   - Handling simpler or faster tasks.\n\n4. **Overall Trend:**\n   - The range of average time gaps highlights a diversity in service styles. Extreme outliers may indicate opportunities for process improvements or specialized training.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n#### For Barbers with Longer Time Gaps:\n1. **Process Streamlining:**\n   - Offer training to enhance efficiency in areas like preparation, execution, and cleanup.\n\n2. **Root Cause Analysis:**\n   - Investigate causes for longer times, such as service complexity, and address recurring inefficiencies.\n\n3. **Leverage Expertise:**\n   - Position these barbers for premium services where additional time aligns with customer expectations.\n\n#### For Efficient Barbers:\n1. **Reward Performance:**\n   - Recognize and incentivize barbers like Muhammad Aliev Mustanir and Dimas Ari Susanto for their efficiency to sustain motivation.\n\n2. **Knowledge Sharing:**\n   - Encourage them to mentor peers by sharing tips for maintaining quality while minimizing time gaps.\n\n#### Operational Improvements:\n1. **Balanced Scheduling:**\n   - Adjust appointment durations based on historical performance metrics to better match each barber’s pace.\n\n2. **Customer Distribution:**\n   - Evenly distribute workload to prevent overburdening efficient barbers and ensure all barbers are fully utilized.\n\n3. **Performance Reviews:**\n   - Continuously monitor average time gaps and provide actionable feedback to maintain balance between speed and quality.\n\n#### Customer Experience:\n1. **Transparency in Service Times:**\n   - Clearly communicate estimated service times to manage expectations and improve satisfaction.\n\n2. **Customized Pricing:**\n   - Introduce pricing tiers that reflect service duration and expertise, ensuring perceived value aligns with customer experiences.","metadata":{}}]}
