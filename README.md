## Data Details:
- **Data Sources:** Transaction data across Barberking outlets.
- **Data Size:** Includes thousands of transaction records segmented by service, payment method, and individual performance metrics.
- **Key Variables:** Transaction amounts, service types, payment methods, transaction times, profit-sharing percentages, and commissions.


## Problem Statement:
